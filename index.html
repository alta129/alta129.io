    <h1>To the Love of My Life</h1>
    <p class="intro">Somewhere in a forest clearing, beneath the quiet hush of leaves, this letter waits for you.</p>
    
    <div class="letter">
      <p>My dearest,</p>
      <p>
        I made this little corner of the internet just for you. Not because I had to, but because you’re the kind of person
        who deserves whole forests carved into code, soft colors turned into poems, and quiet moments remembered forever.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything about you — your laugh, your warmth, the way you see the world — has changed my life like the way light changes trees at golden hour.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love you, endlessly.
      </p>
      <p class="signoff">Yours always,<br/>[Your Name]</p>

      <p>Hey you,</p>
      <p>
        I don't know exactly when I decided to make this — maybe it was after one of those conversations that lingered with me all evening. I just wanted to put something peaceful together. No noise. Just green things and good energy.

        You're the kind of person who makes things feel lighter without even trying. So this is here for you. Come back whenever.
